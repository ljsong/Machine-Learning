# Machine-Learning

These codes are implementations of course [Neural Networks for Machine Learning] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home)
There still be many problems in these codes, and I will update these codes once I get some deeper understanding of neural networks.

## TODO List:

- [x] Mini-batch Learning
- [ ] Stochastical Gradient Descent
- [ ] Regularization
- [ ] Convolution Network
